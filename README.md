# Practicum I Flower Classification
Flower Classification is definetly not something unheard-of but I wanted to do my own from scratch starting from data gathering. This required me to scrape a search engine that I was able to do with the help of a package modified by Joe Clinton. The link to that package is at the very bottom in my reference section. The goal was to get over 100 classes of flowers but due to time contrainst I settled for 90. In the end I gathered roughtly 10,000 images. The actual split ended up being 7,564 for trainging, 1,811 for validation, and 875 for testing. 

## Modeling
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's) are the go to for image recognition so I didn't spend much time thinking about what method I was going to use. After that
